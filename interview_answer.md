# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.
​

1. Explain what a token is used for.
   ​
   Tokens are used for authentication. They are generally given to a client upon log in and removed on log out.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?
   ​
   Make the routes private so that the user needs to be authenticated before they are able to access the data.

3. Describe how web servers work.
   ​  
    The client sends an http request to the server. The server is running and it also contains all the files needed to run the website. The server then sends an http response back to the client.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

   Create has post, Read has get, Update has put, and Delete has delete.
